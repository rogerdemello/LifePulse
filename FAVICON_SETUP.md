# Favicon Setup Instructions

The app is configured to use favicon files. To complete the setup, you need to add favicon images to:

## Required Files:

1. `app/static/img/icons/favicon-32x32.png` (32x32 pixels)
2. `app/static/img/icons/favicon-16x16.png` (16x16 pixels)
3. `app/static/img/icons/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180 pixels)
4. `app/static/img/og-image.png` (1200x630 pixels for social media sharing)

## Quick Setup Options:

### Option 1: Use Favicon Generator
1. Visit https://favicon.io/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload a logo or create a text-based favicon
3. Download the generated files
4. Place them in the `app/static/img/icons/` directory

### Option 2: Create Simple Favicon
1. Create a simple icon/logo in any image editor
2. Resize to the required dimensions
3. Export as PNG files
4. Place in the correct directories
